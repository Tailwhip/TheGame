You can try the following (make a backup of your project folder before or have it in source control). This helped me with UE 4.19.2:

Delete all derived folders & files inside the Unreal project folder (leave only Config, Content & Source folders, and .uproject file).
Re-open Unreal - from the launcher or .uproject.
Generate your IDE project files (Win: via Explorer context menu; Mac: Via Unreal)
Best,
